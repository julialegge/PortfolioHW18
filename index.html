                <p>Julia Legge is a UX/UI designer living in Westminster Colorado! Coming from a background of team management, she has always strived on really getting to know people and solving problems based on what she knows about the people these problems are affecting head on. With that being said, she knows what it means to be a team player, and to bring good intention into every interaction that she has with each individual as well as in her work. Julia is relatively new to the design world, but has had a passion for the visual arts her whole life as her father is an exceptional finish carpenter, and her late grandmother, an incredible multidisciplinary artist. Having been brought up consistently submerged in the realm of the visual arts, Julia has an eye for good design, and strong desire to continue building upon her proficient, but growing skills shown in her work.</p>
